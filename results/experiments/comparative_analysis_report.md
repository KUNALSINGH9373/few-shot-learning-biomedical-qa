# Comparative Analysis Report: Few-Shot vs Fine-Tuning

## Executive Summary
==================================================

**Key Finding**: Few-Shot learning achieved superior performance.

- **Fine-tuning accuracy**: 0.400
- **Best few-shot accuracy**: 0.530
- **Performance gap**: +0.130 (+32.5%)

## Few-Shot Learning Analysis
==================================================

- **Best configuration**: 5-shot prompting
- **Peak accuracy**: 0.530
- **Performance range**: 0.150 - 0.530
- **Variance**: 0.020148

## Key Insights
==================================================
1. Few-shot learning outperformed fine-tuning by 13.0 percentage points
2. This represents a 32.5% relative improvement
3. Small training datasets may lead to overfitting in fine-tuning
4. Pre-trained knowledge preservation is crucial for specialized domains
5. Few-shot performance generally improves with more examples
6. Diminishing returns observed in few-shot scaling

## Practical Implications
==================================================

**Resource Efficiency**: Few-shot learning requires significantly fewer labeled examples
**Training Time**: Few-shot inference vs 12.5 hours of fine-tuning time
**Domain Adaptation**: Pre-trained knowledge preservation vs task-specific specialization

## Recommendations
==================================================

For biomedical QA with limited data: Use few-shot prompting
